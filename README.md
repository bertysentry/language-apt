# language-apt
Syntax highlighting for the APT markup language in Atom.

APT (_Almost Plain Text_) was first published by [XmlMind](http://www.xmlmind.com/)
and is heavily used in [Maven Doxia](https://maven.apache.org/doxia/index.html).
It is sort of similar to MarkDown.

See more information about [APT syntax](https://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html).

All syntax patterns of APT are supported in this grammar package for Atom:
* Title
* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Italic, bold, monospace
* Links
* Lists (ordered and unordered)
* Code blocks
* Tables

It works with most Atom themes.
